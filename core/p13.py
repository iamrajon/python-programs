# random module

# import random

# generating random number between 1 and 6
# x = random.randint(1, 6)
# print(x)
#
# myList = ["rock", "scissor", "paper"]
# z = random.choice(myList)
# print(z)
#
# cards = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, "J", "Q", "K", "A"]
# random.shuffle(cards)
# print(cards)


# Exception Handling
# Exception = events detected during execution that interrupt the flow of program

# try:
#     numerator = int(input("Enter a number to divide: "))
#     denominator = int(input("Enter a number to divide by: "))
#     result = numerator / denominator
#     print(result)
# except ZeroDivisionError as e:
#     print(e)
# except ValueError as e:
#     print(e)
# except Exception as e:
#     print(e)
# finally:
#     print("finally block: This will always execute")


# modules in python
# module = a file containing python code. May contain functions, classes, etc
# used with modular programming, which is to separate program into parts
